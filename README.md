# Parallel-Floyd-Warshall

In this assignment I used PyMP when coding the Floyd Warshall algorithm.
The program will traverse an adjacency matrix and determine the shortest
path between each pair of nodes. 

fwTest.txt is an example input matrix, the result matrix is fwTestResult.txt

## Requirements 

The code should use reasonable decomposition, use reasonable variable names,
and should generally follow good coding standards. 
Important, your assignment should include your name. 

The program shall use the floyd warshal algorithm 
The program shall use mpi to do the work in parallel 
The program shall use an adjacency matrix 
The program shall split work among multiple mpi processes 
The program shall display a portion of the input and final matrices
